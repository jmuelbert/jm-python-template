# User guide

This is where you explain the "what" and "how" of your project's features.

## Configuration

Explain how users can configure the project, including examples of
the `pyproject.toml` or `config.toml` file.

## Command line commands

If your project has a command-line interface, document each command,
its arguments, and options. Using a tool like mkdocs-typer2 can automate this.

```markdown
::: mkdocs-typer2
:module: jm_python_template.main
:name: mkdocs-typer2
:pretty: true
```

::: mkdocs-typer2
:module: jm_python_template.main
:name: app # Use the real-name from the root Typer-Object
:pretty: true
