# API Reference

This is a crucial part of a Python project's documentation. It should be auto-generated from your docstrings.

## Tool:

Use a plugin like mkdocstrings-python with griffe. This reads your docstrings and creates a full, searchable API reference.

## Structure:

The API reference should be organized by module, class, and function. Each entry should include the function signature, parameters, and a description.
